## 📌 Overview

Every year, millions of students leave college without a degree. But what if we could predict who's most at risk — early enough to help?

This analysis explores that question using a dataset from a Portuguese university. By combining demographic, socioeconomic, academic, and macroeconomic features, and running a set of machine learning models, we try to identify students likely to drop out before it happens.

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using custom functions to understand student behavior  
- **Multicollinearity detection** to ensure clean model inputs  
- **Three time-stage datasets (S0, S1, S2)** for a longitudinal modeling approach  
- **Imbalanced classification problem** solved using data-level and algorithm-level techniques (e.g., SMOTE, Balanced Random Forest)  
- **Modeling with CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Ensemble methods**  
- **Evaluation** using F1 scores and Balanced Accuracy

## 📈 Key Findings *(Spoiler Alert)*

- **Academic performance** and **financial responsibility** were top predictors of dropout  
- **Dropout risk can be spotted early**, but prediction accuracy improves significantly after the **first semester**  
- **Balanced Random Forest (BRF)** delivered the most reliable results in this **imbalanced, three-class problem**
